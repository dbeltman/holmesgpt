# HolmesGPT Documentation

**AI-powered troubleshooting and analysis for DevOps and SRE teams**

HolmesGPT is an extensible AI agent that helps users troubleshoot Cloud-Native issues, get cluster information, and investigate alerts by bridging the knowledge gap through AI. Instead of spending hours correlating logs, metrics, and traces across multiple systems, HolmesGPT leverages tool-calling capabilities to integrate with your existing observability tools and organizational knowledge, letting you focus on solutions.
