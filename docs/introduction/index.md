## Why HolmesGPT Exists

Modern DevOps teams face two critical challenges: alert fatigue and knowledge gaps. Infrastructure generates thousands of alerts daily, while troubleshooting often requires expertise scattered across multiple team members and systems. HolmesGPT addresses both challenges through its extensible architecture that can integrate any troubleshooting tool through custom toolsets, while empowering teams to encode their organizational knowledge through natural-language runbooks. This combination of tool-calling capabilities and knowledge integration transforms generic AI models into specialized DevOps assistants.
